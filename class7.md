Work has become more team-focused over the last two decades
While it may seem that collaboration would slow things down and decrease productivity, for software engineers it increases it
Google collected data and attempted to find patterns in what makes up a good team. But there weren’t factors about the individual team members that were consistent across all productive teams.
They found that each group had distinct norms, even if they weren’t explicitly stated by the group leaders.
A few commonalities were seen between successful groups in further research:
People spoke roughly the same amount as other group members. There was equality in air-time
Teams who had people who had higher emotional intelligence and who were more responsive to social cues, did better on tasks
Psychological Safety is the safety felt in taking risks around other people. It is having trust in those around you, and feeling like you can be yourself. This is the measure that researchers found to be most important to building a good group dynamic.

The http specifies to the browser the type of protocol to use. Polymorphism is when different nouns can have same verb applied.

Who is Roy Fielding?Links to an external site.
He was one of the first computer scientists to build HTTP specifications. He helped to write web servers that send documents.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?Links to an external site.
The way the web was designed was not for all machines to talk to all other machines- it was not a primary concern.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?Links to an external site.
HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This protocol follows a request-response protocol A web browser makes a request and ‘gets’ the data from the server

GET what the browser’s main action verb is. It gets information. A machine gets machine-readable info and the browser gets the human readable info. POST a system adding something to another system PATCH a system doing a partial update of another PUT a system replacing something in another system



get ?
GET is used to retrieve and request data from a specified resource in a server. GET is one of the most popular HTTP request techniques. In simple words, the GET method is used to retrieve whatever information is identified by the Request-URL.

POST ?
POST (Power-On Self-Test) is the diagnostic testing sequence that a computer’s basic input/output system (or “starting program”) runs to determine if the computer keyboard, random access memory, disk drives, and other hardware are working correctly.

PUT ?
PUT method is used to update resource available on the server. Typically, it replaces whatever exists at the target URL with something else. You can use it to make a new resource or overwrite an existing one

patch ?
A patch is a set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches usually being called bugfixes or bug fixes.
